After hearing so many recommendations about The Phoenix Project, I finally decided to read it. It didn’t disappoint: it’s one of the best IT books I’ve come across. I finished it in less than a week, completely drawn in by the way everything was explained.

This book tells the story of an IT company bursting in flames, saved by incorporating DevOps methodologies. It is entertaining, but also nourishing, as it explains every concept. Since it’s narrating a company’s tales, it provides real-life examples on situations, plans, ideas and outcomes.

The Phoenix Project motivates you to keep pursuing your career as a DevOps Engineer, showing how DevOps improves processes, collaboration, reliability, security and so on. As a Software Developer shifting her career into DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering, reading this book has encouraged me to keep moving forward and to apply these ideas in real projects.

If you’re not into reading, it might be a good fit for you anyways, because it’s narrated as a fictional story, catching you and entertaining you while you learn the Three Ways and other DevOps concepts, ideas and practices. If you like reading, then you’re going to love this book.

If you’re a manager, it can be useful for you as well, as it has some nice ideas regarding that topic. However, the best case for readiang this book is people who are, or are pursuing a career in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering.
